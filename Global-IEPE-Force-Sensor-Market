Growth of Quality Control Process and Precision Manufacturing: Precision and quality are parts of the essence in manufacturing. IEPE force sensors are widely adopted in the monitoring and control processes of a wide array of manufacturing processes to ensure the highest conformance to very stringent quality standards. Increasing automation levels in the market together with the rise of Industry 4.0 are also contributing toward growth in the market.

Expansion in Research and Development Activities: The IEPE force sensors have proliferated in research laboratories and academic research for experimenting on and analyzing specimens. The increase in the number of research in material science, biomechanics, also structural engineering has had a positive impact on the market.

High Sensor Cost: High costs associated with these sensors are considered one of the key challenges for the IEPE force sensor market. Though they provide better output, the cost to be met at the very beginning of the IEPE force sensor production series becomes an inhibiting factor for small and medium-sized enterprises and research institutions with low budgets.

Complex installation and calibration: IEPE force sensors are installed with great care and later calibrated to ensure that they provide measurements with precision. The complexity involved in its setup may challenge an end-user, especially one with little technical expertise.

Low Awareness and Adoption in the Emerging Markets: In most of the developing economies, awareness and adoption rates of cutting-edge sensor technologies including IEPE force sensors are low. This can be due to the lack of technical know-how, infrastructure, and budgetary constraints. Overcoming these barriers requires targeted education and awareness programs.
